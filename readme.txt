# 📦 Pincode Availability Checker – WordPress Gutenberg Block Plugin

**Pincode Availability Checker** is a lightweight, dynamic Gutenberg block plugin that allows site visitors to check if their pincode is serviceable (i.e., eligible for delivery) based on a list configured by the site admin.

Visitors can input their pincode, and the plugin will remember it for up to a month using cookies. On future visits, the block will automatically pre-fill and re-check the delivery status — improving UX and reducing friction.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Gutenberg block to collect and check user pincode
- 🧠 Auto-prefills saved pincode from browser cookies

- ⚙️ Admin interface to manage deliverable pincodes (one per line)

## 🛠 How It Works

1. Add the **Pincode Availability Checker block** to any post or page via the block editor.
2. Admins can configure the list of valid pincodes under:
   **Settings → Pincode Settings**
3. Users can:
   - Enter their pincode
   - Get instant feedback on delivery availability
   - Have their pincode saved in the browser for next time
4. On page load, if a cookie is present, the block auto-checks without user interaction.

## 🔧 Admin Setup

2. Enter one valid pincode **per line**.
3. Save changes.

## 📦 Block Styling

The block supports basic Gutenberg styling:

- Text and background colors
- Padding and margin spacing
- Typography (via block support)

All styles can be applied via the block sidebar.
